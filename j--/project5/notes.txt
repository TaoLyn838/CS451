   Swami Iyer         Instructor   Issue: My got duplicate output from ExceptionHandlers and stuck on JTryStatement.

                                   Solution: Professor Swami point out me to use "javap -varbose" comment line to get
                                             the bytecode of `ExceptionHandlers` and `JTryStatement` debug. I then find
                                             that I call "tryBlock.codegen(output)" twice. Finally, I get correct output
                                             from ExceptionHandlers.
