   Swami Iyer         Instructor   When I followed J-- grammar to write the forInit() method, I encountered
                                     two different return types: ArrayList<JVariableDeclarator> and
                                     ArrayList<JStatement>. Professor Swami pointed out that I could add
                                     JVariableDeclaration as an element into ArrayList<JStatement>, and
                                     showed me an example using localVariableDeclarationStatement(). I realized
                                     that JVariableDeclaration extends JStatement, which means it's an acceptable
                                     type for the JStatement ArrayList.
