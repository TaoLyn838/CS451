4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   This project is very similar to the parser project from before, so 
	it is not hard to handle at the start. IntelliJ IDEA supports 
	the j-- file syntax, which has helped me a lot!
