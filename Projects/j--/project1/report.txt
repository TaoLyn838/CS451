   Swami Iyer         Professor    Example how stack works to me.

4. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Using CLEmitter)
      Approach: 1) Reading GenFactorial program as an example for question 1.
      I then start understanding the meaning of moethods in ClEmitter.
      2) Taking a paper and pen to draw the stack. It makes me easier to
      design this program.
      Issues and resolution: ERROR: "([Ljava/lang/String;)V) Expecting to
      find integer on stack."
      Solution: From the start, I draw the stack to check each
      variable again and again, but still can't find where is the error
      coming from. I then asked Professor Swami, he spirits me that I need
      to pop all value out from stack at the end of stack. So, I check my
      code again, and rewrite my code. After these process, I run my code
      again, but still report the same error as the beginning. But this
      time, I believe that the error is not about my stack, it is
      somewhere else.
      Finally, I see that type a string with "(Ljava/lang/String;)I" in
      out.print. It is why error says "Expecting a Int value."
      I fixed it when I rewrite it becomes
       "(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/StringBuffer;".
      This error stuck me one week more on question 1.

   Problem 2 (Arithmetic Operations)
      Approach: Write the lecture:compilation. Following the tutorial
      step by step.

      Issues and resolution: JUnaryPlusOp takes me about 2 hours because
      I forget add JComplementOp in Parser.

   Problem 3 (Bitwise Operations)
      Approach: It is easy after I finish question2.

      Issues and resolution: No.

   Problem 4 (Shift Operations)
      Approach: It is easy after I finish question2.

      Issues and resolution: No.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   It is hard for me from the beginning because I am unfamiliar with j--.
   I almost took about 8 days to get cracking on the project. But this
   project become easier when I familiar with j-- and stack, I free fun
   at the end:)
